=head1 NAME

self - Provides "self" and "args" keywords in your OO program.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes self version 0.0.1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyModule;
    use self;

    # Write constructor as usual
    sub new {
        return bless({}, shift);
    }

    # 'self' is special now.
    sub foo {
        self->{foo}
    }

    # 'args' too
    sub set {
        my ($foo, $bar) = args;

        self->{bar} = $bar;
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This moudles adds C<self> and C<args> keywords in your Perl OO module. It's really just
handy helpers to get rid of:

    my $self = shift;

Basically, C<self> is just eqaul to C<$_[0]>, and C<args> is just C<$_[1..$#_]>.

Noted that they are not scalar variables, but barewords.
